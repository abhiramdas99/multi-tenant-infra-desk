📌 MY PROJECT CONTEXT — “MULTI TENANT INFRA DESK” (DJANGO + ADMIN CUSTOMIZATION)

I’m building a Django-based admin system called Multi-Tenant Infra Desk.

It is used for managing multiple IT consulting tenants → their clients → projects → environments → servers → resources → issues → infra activities.

📌 MODELS THAT ARE ALREADY CREATED

Partner (top entity: Kamsoft, Kilowott, etc.)

Client (each partner has multiple clients)

Project (each client has multiple projects)

Environment (dev/staging/uat/prod etc.)

Server (linked to environment)

Resource (DB credentials, S3 bucket, API keys, etc.)

Issue (daily issues: title, desc, status, priority…)

InfraActivity (activity log: what task was done, hours used etc.)

Admin is fully working with these models.

📌 IMPORTANT: CUSTOM ADMIN HEADER UI CREATED

The default Django admin header is replaced with a custom professional header:

Left:

“Infra Desk Administration”

Right side (this order):

Search box (global search across all models)

Username (admin)

Avatar circle (first letter of username)

Avatar dropdown showing:

Change password

Log out (POST form, working correctly)

We also removed:

“WELCOME”

“view site”

all default Django admin texts

CSS is fully customized.

📌 GLOBAL SEARCH SYSTEM ADDED

There is a global search bar that searches across ALL models:

Partner

Client

Project

Environment

Server

Resource

Issue

InfraActivity

Django Users

It shows results in a table:

model type

object label

link to that admin change form

Search page URL:
/admin/global-search/

Template: templates/admin/global_search.html

📌 URL STRUCTURE

/ → loads home.html
/admin/ → admin dashboard
/admin/global-search/ → global search
Custom templates path enabled in settings.

📌 LOGOUT ISSUE FIXED

Django requires POST for logout.
So dropdown uses:

<form method="post" action="{% url 'admin:logout' %}">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <button type="submit" class="logout-btn">Log out</button>
</form>


This works correctly.

📌 CUSTOM ADMIN THEME DETAILS

Search box uses custom styling

Avatar dropdown has solid white background (not transparent)

Hover effect added

Clean spacing

No inline styling except where required

Menu works with JS toggle

“WELCOME” removed

“view site” removed

Search box appears before username

Dark teal admin bar remains default Django color

📌 WHAT I WANT IN FUTURE DISCUSSIONS

Whenever I start a new chat, understand that:

⚡ I am building
A full Multi-Tenant Infra Management System
inside Django Admin, highly customized.

You should:

Continue UI improvements in admin

Help build dashboards, charts, permissions, audit logs, notifications

Extend models where required

Improve UX for real-world infra management

Avoid re-explaining basics — continue from this personalized setup

Keep the admin sleek, professional, SaaS-like
